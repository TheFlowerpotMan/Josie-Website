            I design a variety of objects and make them with a variety materials for a 
            variety of people. Whether it be private clients, well known brand names or 
            commercial businesses.<br>Imagining and manufacturing objects, varying in size 
            and purpose, whatever the brief, I endeavor to create beautifully simple work 
            within which form and function are equal entities.<br>I have also worked as part 
            of larger teams creating some pretty phenomenal installations. These include; Vevo, 
            NME and Virgin Trains.<br>My work has previously been recognized and supported by 
            brands such as Anglepoise and Kvadrat fabrics. My creations have also featured at 
            music events and marketing campaigns across the UK.
